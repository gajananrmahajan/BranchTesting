Explanation of each folder:

src: This directory contains the source code of your project.
main: This directory contains the main source code of your project.
java: Java source code files reside here.
your.package.name: This package represents your project's package structure.
stepdefinitions: This package or folder contains the step definition files where you define the implementation of your Cucumber steps.
utils: This package may contain utility classes that you may need in your step definitions or elsewhere in your project.
resources: Resources used in the project.
features: This directory contains your Cucumber feature files, where you write your scenarios in Gherkin syntax.
config: This directory can contain configuration files needed for your project, such as property files or XML configurations.
test: This directory contains the test source code of your project.
java: Java test source code files reside here.
your.package.name: Test source code files are organized similarly to the main source code.
runners: This package or folder contains the test runners, which are Java classes responsible for executing Cucumber tests.
pom.xml: This is the Maven project configuration file. It defines project dependencies, build settings, and other project-specific configurations.
This structure helps maintain a clean separation between your source code, test code, and resources, making it easier to manage and maintain your Cucumber project.
